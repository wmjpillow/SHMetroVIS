TVCG Template
---

This is my own personal paper writing template.

You'll find some scripts for proofreading (proof.sh), and auto-compiling (watch.sh).

However, you can ignore those and focus on the `makefile` which will compile the paper for you on demand.

If you have your own LaTeX setup, you can probably compile in your own tools.

Finally, if you aren't using LaTeX at all, you can search for a TVCG word template, likely available online.
